# eb-py-flask-signup
This Python sample application uses the [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) framework and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) to build a simple, scalable customer signup form that is deployed to [AWS Elastic Beanstalk](http://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/). The application stores data in [Amazon DynamoDB](http://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) and publishes notifications to the [Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)](http://aws.amazon.com/sns/) when a customer fills out the form.

## Instructional Videos
This app includes a quick 3-part video series on YouTube that will walk you through deploying, using, and customizing the application in 10 minutes or less.
